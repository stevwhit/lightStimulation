## quickstart
This is code copied from google to authorize the SMTP connection for the IP start up code

## IP Address Start Up code
This code reads the device's IP address and sends an email out with the IP address for easy connection.

## todo:
### requirements:
- create better input validation for user input
- start PWM from user input
- add ability for user to stop and restart whil running
- add runtime information, so that while the LEDs are flashing and the program is running, a timer is set
- add controls for user to start, and then later stop the programmed

### nice to have:
- something that will store programmed settings in memory so user can access them later
- add abiliyt for user to set the code to run for a certain amount of time instead of manually stopping it
